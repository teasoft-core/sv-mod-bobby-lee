Welcome to Pelican Town, Bobby! This mod adds the one and only Bobby Lee as a new, fully-featured resident of Stardew Valley. He might seem a little off-beat at first, but get to know him, and you might just find the most loyal friend you've ever had.

## Features

*   **A New Villager:** Adds Bobby Lee as a custom NPC, complete with unique character sprites and portraits.
*   **Custom House:** Bobby lives in his own cozy (and probably a little messy) house near Penny's trailer in Pelican Town.
*   **Unique Dialogue:** He's a fountain of knowledge... of a sort. Talk to him daily to hear obscure trivia, strange observations, and sometimes surprisingly profound thoughts about life in the valley.
*   **Your Unlikely Guardian:** As you become friends, Bobby takes a protective interest in your well-being. He'll be the one to rescue you if you're ever knocked out in the mines, bringing you safely home.
*   **Full NPC Functionality:** Includes a daily schedule that sees him wandering town, gift tastes to discover, and custom event compatibility.

## Meet Bobby Lee

Bobby Lee is the new guy in town, and he's... different. He spends his days contemplating the deeper mysteries of the valley, like whether a Junimo can cry and what Mayor Lewis is *really* doing with all those truffle oil requests.

He's got his quirks and can be a bit blunt, but underneath the rough edges is a heart of gold. He understands what it's like to be an outsider and quickly develops a soft spot for the new farmer. Build a friendship with him, and you'll discover a surprisingly loyal protector who has your back when things get dangerous. He's the friend you never knew you needed.
